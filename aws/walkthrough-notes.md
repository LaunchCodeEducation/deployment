This walkthrough utilized aws as the cloud service to deploy a web application. There are multiple cloud service providers that have their own use cases! Below I will list some that I have used personally and what use-cases I like them for.


[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/): DigitalOcean is a fantastic choice for personal use! Their platform is very beginner-friendly and a lot of the configuration that is necessary when working with platforms like aws, azure, and gcp is automatically configured by DigitalOcean. You are still able to customize networking to your own needs and use-cases but it has most options configured from the get-go.
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/): AWS is widely used across the industry and is very customizable for each and every use-case. AWS is also very secure as all services and resources that you create are required to be within a VPC (virtual private cloud). 
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us): Azure is highly used amongst the public service sector.
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
