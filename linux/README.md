## Linux Introduction

Linux started as a passion project by Linus Torvalds. He was a fan of the open source operating system Minix and modeled aspects of his new kernel after Minix.

A kernel is the fundamental aspect of an Operating System. The kernel interfaces with hardware, manages memory, devices, and contains a File System. In essence all actions performed by a computer are handled by the kernel.

Linux is now and has always been a kernel not a full operating system. In order to be an operating system that could be effectively used by people Linus packaged his Linux kernel with Bash (a shell) and GCC (a C compiler). Still to this day the Linux kernel comes bundled together with various tools to make a variety of custom built operating systems commonly called Linux distributions.

The popularity of Linux grew steadily over the years as more tools were developed for or implemented to run using the Linux kernel. The open source nature of the Linux Kernel and GNU projects allowed for highly customized and varied Linux distributions.

Some of the ways these Linux distributions are used:

- Personal use operating system (like MacOS or Windows)
- Mobile devices (Android)
- Embedded systems (like car computers, or single board computers)
- Cloud Computing: Linux distributions dominate the various cloud services that power the internet

Linuxâ€™s popularity especially as it pertains to the web and cloud computing makes it an attractive tool to learn about as you continue your journey in technology.
