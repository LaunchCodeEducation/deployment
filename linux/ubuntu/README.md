## Ubuntu Intro

Ubuntu is a very popular Linux distrubution created and maintained by [Canonical](https://canonical.com/). Ubuntu is a great choice for a desktop or laptop computer but is most widely used for virtual servers. It has a lot of community support and is open-source so it is free to use within the Cloud as your host OS. 

Ubuntu like many other Linux distrubutions makes installing and managing software very easy and straight-forward.
