## Intro to DNS

Domain Name Systems will be something that you will need to work with in order to configure your own server. Configuring a custom domain like "your-name.org" will first need to be purchased through a domain registrar. After your purchase the rights to the domain name you can then resolve a more "human-readable" name to your server ip-address.

There are a couple of benefits by doing such a thing:
- customization of URL
- Not exposing your ip-address
- easier access to your website
