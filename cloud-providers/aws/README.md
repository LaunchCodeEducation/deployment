## AWS Intro

Amazon first began offering Information Technology services in 2006. The goal was to create a platform that allowed businesses and individuals alike to replace any infrastructure or on-premise servers with virtaul servers provided by AWS.

Amazon created this platform as a low-cost alternative within the cloud that is highly scalable, reliable, and performance optimized.

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud and Amazon S3 are among the first services provided by AWS. These first-generation services are still used to this day but have of course changed over time.

AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a widely used cloud provider with a VERY large amount of resources/services (something like 278 at the time of writing this) at your disposal. The platform is extremely customizable to your personal or business needs. You can find the documentation here: [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)
